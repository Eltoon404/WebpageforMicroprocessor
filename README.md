# ðŸ”§ Microprocessor Basics Project

This project is a simple and educational overview of **how microprocessors work**, designed for students or beginners in electronics and computer engineering.

## ðŸ“˜ What Is a Microprocessor?

A **microprocessor** is the brain of a computer. It is a programmable device that takes input, processes it according to instructions (software), and gives output. It performs tasks such as arithmetic operations, data movement, and decision making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Explain the key components of a microprocessor
- Show how it processes instructions (Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle)
- Demonstrate basic instruction flow using diagrams or simulation
- Help beginners understand how microprocessors control digital devices
